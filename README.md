Python AI Algorithms and Problem Solving
This repository contains Python programs implementing various algorithms and solving common problems such as maze solving, water jug problem, graph traversal, and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Below is an overview of each program included in this repository:

Programs Included
Depth-First Search (DFS) Maze Solver

Filename: maze_solver_dfs.py
Description: This program solves a maze using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. It finds a path from the start to the end of the maze if one exists.
Usage: Run the script and provide the maze as input.
Water Jug Problem Solver

Filename: water_jug_solver.py
Description: This program solves the Water Jug problem using a recursive approach. It finds a sequence of steps to measure a target amount of water using given jugs.
Usage: Run the script and follow the prompts to enter jug capacities and the target amount.
Latin Pattern Generator

Filename: latin_pattern_generator.py
Description: This program generates a Latin pattern based on a given number. It prints a triangular pattern of numbers in ascending and descending order.
Usage: Run the script and provide a number as input.
Traveling Salesman Problem Solver (Brute Force)

Filename: tsp_brute_force.py
Description: This program solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using brute force with itertools.permutations. It finds the optimal path and minimum cost by considering all possible permutations.
Usage: Run the script with a graph as input to find the optimal path and minimum cost.
Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)

Filename: graph_traversal.py
Description: This program implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for graph traversal. It demonstrates how to traverse a graph and find paths between nodes.
Usage: Run the script and provide the graph details to perform BFS or DFS traversal.
State Coloring Problem Solver

Filename: state_coloring.py
Description: This program solves the state coloring problem by assigning colors to states such that no two adjacent states have the same color. It uses a greedy approach to assign colors efficiently.
Usage: Run the script to see the color assignments for each state.
