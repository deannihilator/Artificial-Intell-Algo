# Python Algorithms and Problem Solving

This repository contains Python programs implementing various algorithms and solving common problems. Below is an overview of each program included in this repository:

## Programs Included

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Maze Solver**
   - Filename: `DepthFirstSearch.py`
   - Filename: `RatInaMaze.py`
   - Description: Solves a maze using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Finds a path from the start to the end of the maze if one exists.

2. **Water Jug Problem Solver**
   - Filename: `WaterJug.py`
   - Description: Solves the Water Jug problem using a recursive approach. Finds a sequence of steps to measure a target amount of water using given jugs.

3. **Latin Pattern Generator**
   - Filename: `LatinSquare.py`
   - Description: Generates a Latin pattern based on a given number. Prints a triangular pattern of numbers in ascending and descending order.

4. **Traveling Salesman Problem Solver (Brute Force)**
   - Filename: `TravellingSalesman.py`
   - Description: Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using brute force with itertools.permutations. Finds the optimal path and minimum cost by considering all possible permutations.

5. **Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)**
   - Filename: `Best-First-Search.py`
   - Description: Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms for graph traversal. Demonstrates how to traverse a graph and find paths between nodes.

6. **State Coloring Problem Solver**
   - Filename: `GraphColoring.py`
   - Description: Solves the state coloring problem by assigning colors to states such that no two adjacent states have the same color. Uses a greedy approach to assign colors efficiently.

**Dependencies**
Python 3.x
itertools (standard library)
